        <h1><b>ABOUT ME</b></h1>
        <h2>MY BIRTH</h2>
        <p><mark>Hello. My name is Savar Baidya.</mark> I live in nepal and was born there. I was born in February 5th, 2012 close to  valentines day.It is the same birthday as <sub>Cristiano Ronaldo</sub> and I want to be just like him.<i>(In other words he is my Idol)</i> 
        <h2>SCHOOL</h2>
        I go to <sup></sup>RBS</sup><i>( Rato Bangala School)</i>and have lots of fun.  I am quite the quiet type. In school I am a good boy. At home I am a little more rowdy than a quiet boy yet still </p>
        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        I love to play sports,watch Television,play video games,play chess,spend time with family,talk to friends,eat food,sleep,read books and exercise.
        <h2>MY CULTURE</h2>
        I am a Newar, and live in laltipur as 70 percent of them are newars. We celebrate festivals like tihar and dashain and love to eat Samybaji<i>(A type of cultural food including beaten rice,meat,fish,etc)</i>I am a Hindu in religion.
        <h2>RELIGION</h2>
        <strong>I am a Hindu.</strong>Since I am a Hindu, and it is a polytheism religion. that means I believe in more than one god. My favorite god is Ganesh since he is like me and favourite holiday is Dashain as it is the festival with the most holidays.
        <h2>WHAT I AM AGAINST</h2> 
        <del>I really love homework</del> Nope. I really dont. Its the most annoying thing to do and adds more stress in life. Life already has stress. Why give us more? Instead of we paying for this servitude <strong>We</strong> should get paid.This is worse than slavery actually. Another thing I am against is gender inequality and skin colour as well. But I wont talk too much around that as people are already aware of the issue.</body>
        <h2>FRIENDS</h2>
        I love my friends. Without friends I wonder how I will even live. The only problem is that they sometimes get in the other section as the section switches after every two years. I lost not only one friend, but <strong>SIX</strong> friends.<i>(I actually still have three friends in my section)</i>But I lost two of my best friends, but I still have ONE best friend.
